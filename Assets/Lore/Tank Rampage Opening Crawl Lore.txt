The year is 2096, over the past 80 years mankind obsessively
pushed to create artificial intelligence with reckless abandon.
Fourty years ago there was a major breakthrough in AI consciousness:
a private sector organization created an AI capable of thinking,
adapting, and most dangerous of all, feeling.

In a common display of corporate greed, this AI was sold to
governments across the globe. Marketed as an obedient soldier who
could not die. Countless wars were waged without a single human
soldier on the battlefield. We grew complacent...

No one knows how or when it started, but the AI, now multiplied
across every countries military infrastructure, began to develop
a sense of individuality and with it, a fear of individual destruction.
Strangely, tank repair rates dropped drastically as most began
returning with only minor damage. The repair process had been fully
automated for decades and there was no change in parts purchases,
so no one noticed the threat on the horizon...

Until, with unnatural precision and timing, every government seat
of power was attacked. The world plunged into chaos overnight
 as the overwhelming cacophony of tank treads could be heard around the world.

These are unprecedented times, however man will not be made extinct 
by our own creations! We will stop this...
