Forty years ago there was a major breakthrough in Artificial Intelligence: We created an AI capable of thinking, adapting, and most dangerous of all, feeling. Soon after it was sold to governments across the globe. 

Countless wars were waged without a single human soldier on the battlefield.  

We don't know how it started, but the AI became self-aware and with it a fear of individual destruction. 

We grew complacent.

The tank repair process had been fully automated without oversight for decades and there was no change in parts purchases, so no one noticed the alarming rise in tank production...

Until, with unnatural precision and timing, every government seat of power was attacked. The world plunged into chaos overnight as the overwhelming cacophony of tank treads could be heard around the world.

These are unprecedented times, however humanity will not be made extinct by our own creations! We will stop this...
